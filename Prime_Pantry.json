It is a very good quality plastic wrap, but the delivery system is poorly executed, and this makes usage more frustrating and less time-efficient. As convenience is one of the core selling points of this sort of product, how easy it is to use is just as important as how good the wrap itself is.\n\nAs another user here noted, getting this stuff out of the box and tearing off the portion you need to use is very difficult. Substantial force is required to do this due to a cutting system that is lacking, and this can result in the box being damaged as it is not a very robust box. It can also cause the piece you are attempting to tear off fold up from the pressure upon being torn, leaving you with a tangled mess to untangle. As the blade itself does not do a great job cutting, sometimes the wrap will tear, leaving you with a piece that is a different size than you wanted. The physical location of where the wrap comes out relative to where it is cut at also results in one having to hold at an awkward angle to see what they are doing, making all of this more difficult.\n\nI use clear wrap multiple times a day...the difference between a delivery system that is easy versus difficult means a lot of time savings, and a lot of frustration that does not have to occur. This is a good quality wrap, but like Glad's wrap, it's delivery system is lacking compared to other products (such as the Kirkland clear wraps) and so the convenience factor is reduced. So I think that you will find that an alternative clear wrap product with a better system for dispensing & cutting is more enjoyable to use, and much more convenient.", "summary": "The wrap is fantastic, but the dispensing, cutting, & packaging is lackluster, making the Saran less convenient & time-saving", "unixReviewTime": 1409529600}

You see, I work for a fine dining restaurant and our chef, I kid you not, must be the spawn of Hell's kitchen. We had a dish which until put in the bread bowl and mixed, remained rather soupy. It would constantly spill in the fridge and get all over the other items we were in the process of cooking. Who should go down for this incident? None other than me. So, I had tried plastic wear-it leaked, foil-also leaked, plus allows for fridge smells to seep in from the other food. So, with this dilema before me, and an extremely angry chef behind my right shoulder, I thought. Most plastic wraps never seemed to work. It was out of the question for me. We did not keep them in the kitchen due to the sticking to hot food items and melting near the ovens. Keeping all other air out and the food in until mixing time was my top priority and the Chef punished me every time there was a spill. This is my job, I should be able to look forward to it not dread the very moment I open the fridge. Didn't anyone ever tell the chef not to cry over spilled milk? Anyway, I finally was at the point of giving up. I came across a box of Saran Plastic Wrap on the counter and thought it couldn't hurt to through it on. At once it clung perfectly to the bow. I was able to seal and push out all the air and move it in the fridge with ease. There were no messes, no more spills, and the chef did not try and drown me in the soup for these messy mistakes so, you see, Saran Wrap saved my life!!!!<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Saran-Premium-Plastic-Wrap-Heavy-Duty-100-sq-ft/dp/B0000DIWNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saran Premium Plastic Wrap, Heavy Duty 100 sq ft</a>", "summary": "SARAN WRAP SAVED MY LIFE!!", "unixReviewTime": 1300924800}

It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.\n\nGrind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.

My only reason for trying this brand was BECAUSE it is labeled as Solid White Albacore, the price was better than my grocery store, and I had some room in my pantry box so this product popped up as a recommendation.  Had I come to the page and looked at the reviews or the photographs, I would absolutely positively passed on buying it.  The rusty cans shown at the top of the product page are disgusting.

It isn't very good.\nThe tuna is really mushy. The texture is close to unpleasant, in fact. Think if you opened a regular can of tuna and ran it through the food processor, water and all. That's what you'd have. Sort of like tuna paste!  The taste wasn't all that either. I tried adding a little mayo, but that didn't help either. So, I have 23 more cans of tuna paste!  Better than starving, great for camping, and that's about all I can say for it.\n\nOh yeah - great packaging.\nI expected a box with 24 cans in it, like cat food.

Amazon's price was as cheap as my local store so I bought a few cans.\nThe best thing I can say about it is, well, it's convenient and relatively inexpensive.\nTaste? What there is of it is mildly fishy. Not in a bad 'old' fishy way, just a bit fishy. It might be called Chicken of the Sea, but there is no mistaking it for anything but tuna fish from a can.\n\nAfter getting the American tuna, this is pretty bad, but this is a fraction of the cost. My cans had an even mix of chunks and flakes. Better than the no name store brands. Another good thing is the long shelf life. It seems like the dates on tuna cans are always later than other canned goods like vegetables or soups.\n\nIf you really like tuna, the American one is a nice splurge once in a while, but this is an ok everyday tuna for casseroles and tuna melts.", "summary": "Everyday  Tuna", "unixReviewTime": 1423526400}
